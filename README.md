Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a 25,000+ record retail dataset to uncover key business insights using SQL, Python, and Tableau.
The goal was to identify top-performing stores, understand the impact of discounts, and visualize category-wise sales trends through interactive dashboards.

Objectives

Understand sales patterns and store performance across regions.

Analyze how discounts affect overall sales.

Build interactive dashboards for decision-making.

Derive actionable insights to improve business strategy.

Data Preparation & Cleaning

Handled 10,000+ null values and removed duplicate entries.

Standardized data formats (dates, categories, store names).

Created new derived metrics for deeper insights (e.g., discount ratio, sales per store).

Exported cleaned data as CSV for SQL and Tableau integration.

SQL Analysis (18 Queries Executed)

Aggregated and filtered data using GROUP BY, JOIN, and CASE WHEN statements.

Identified top 3 stores contributing ~45% of total sales.

Analyzed weekly and monthly sales trends.

Assessed discount performance and its correlation with total revenue.

Tableau Dashboards

Built a multi-chart interactive dashboard to analyze sales patterns across discounts, weather conditions, stock levels, and category combinations.

Identified key demand drivers such as weekend uplift, discount effectiveness, and weather-driven sales (temperature + humidity impact).

Revealed that holiday-only days don’t increase sales — highest uplift occurs during Holiday + Activity events with strong discounting.

Key Insights

Top 3 stores generated 45% of total sales.

Discounts above 20% resulted in declining profit margins.

Category “Electronics” performed best during festive weeks.

Some stores showed high sales volatility, indicating inconsistent customer behavior.
